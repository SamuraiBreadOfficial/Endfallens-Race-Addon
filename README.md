# Music Player
## How Does the [Music Player] Work? ðŸŽµ
It's really simple! Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

## Converting Vanilla Music Discs
To play a standard Minecraft Music Disc in the ERA Music Player, you first need to convert it into ERAâ€™s special version. Donâ€™t worryâ€”itâ€™s an easy process!

Open your inventory crafting grid.
Place a vanilla Music Disc in any crafting slot.
This will transform it into the ERA Music Disc version.

Once you have the ERA version of the disc:
Put it in your off-hand slot.
Use the Music Player itemâ€”and voilÃ ! The Music Player is ready to go! ðŸŽ¶

## ERA-Exclusive Music Discs
If you're using new music discs added by ERA, you donâ€™t need to convert them. Simply:
Place the disc in your off-hand.
Use the Music Player itemâ€”and enjoy the music!

Now youâ€™re all set to experience ERAâ€™s music system in the best way possible! ðŸŽ§âœ¨
